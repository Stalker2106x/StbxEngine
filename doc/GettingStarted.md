## Getting Started ##

StbxEngine is cross-platform and supports variety of platforms, thanks to portability of SFML.\n
It supports Windows, Linux and MacOS out of the box, and hopefully Android & iOS; check [SFML website](https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php) for further info.\n

### Set up your environment

There is two ways of using StbxEngine in your projects:\n

You can use precompiled StbxEngine binaires for your platform.\n
This method is the simplest, and should work out of the box for most platforms.\n
Follow the [Precompiled libs guide](./md_doc_SetUpEnvironmentPrecompiled.html) 

You can build the whole library AND dependencies to compile for any target platform (even a not pre-built one).\n
This is preferred for advanced users, if you use a standard platform and want a fast approach to the Engine, give the previous method a shot!\n
Follow the [Build youself guide](./md_doc_SetUpEnvironmentBuild.html)
