bug:

-cursor lateral movement is not based on exact font width => LOOKS FIXED
-screenshot no arg segfault+unable to write
-when moving cursor: always doing lastInput instead of current
-browsing history up and down cause: terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'
  what():  basic_string::_M_create
  -> probably because of cursor error;
-when console is toggled, first char should not count if key is ascii.
