BUG:
-screenshot command is unable to write
-when console is toggled, first char should not count if key is ascii.
-show usage on errors
-link hover state does not update on creation
-fill bar of menuslider goes out of range on x max
-add a method in engine to get mouse position relative to window

FEATURE:
1-add param xml "command" to bind command to link
2-add a command "debuginfo" to draw DEBUGINFO PANEL (extendable via c++)
3-add a command "alias" to set shorter commands aliases

EXTENDABLE:
-add a command "sound_stop" to stop all sounds, "sound_volume" etc...
-add a support for copy paste { needs cross platform abstraction }
-add a HUD layer { commmand "hud_show" to enable, command "hud_color" to set color }
