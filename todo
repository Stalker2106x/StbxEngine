BUG:
-screenshot command is unable to write
-"debuginfo" is broken
-console is not an HUDPanel
-nested commands in console do not execute; syntax error
-GUILink, make GUIMenuLink inherit from it, and GUILinkButton, a class that adds
link button to gui. it should steal all of GUIMenuLink implementation, and clean
off GUIMenuLink
-GUIMenu should get rid of atoi, atof, convertBool.... And use pugixml
implementation of as_int, as_bool, ..., furthermore, as they take a default
value as parameter, we can stop all the tests we made, and go through all
supported params one by one without checking if they exists.

FEATURE:
-show list of predicates under console input
1-add a command "addpanel" to add panel
2-resize static panel
3-add a grid element to HUDElement
4-add a jukebox
5-add a command "alias" to set shorter commands aliases
6-allow developer to extend debuginfo via c++)

EXTENDABLE:
-add a command "sound_stop" to stop all sounds, "sound_volume" etc...
-add a support for copy paste { needs cross platform abstraction }
